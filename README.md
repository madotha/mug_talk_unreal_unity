# MUG Talk: Mobile Game Development - Unreal / Unity

This repository contains the source code for a 3D sidescroller game, developed in Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 5.
The code and instructions on how to build and run it on an Android device or emulator can be found in the respective folders.
(I strongly recommend using an Android device rather than an emulator to provide the best possible gameplay experience).

The following versions of the engines have been used:

* `HighTowerUE4` : Created in Unreal Engine 4.23.1
* `HighTowerUnity` : Created in Unity 2019.2.6f1

## Important: Enable USB Debugging

It is necessary for both projects to have USB debugging enabled on your target device.
If you haven't already enabled this setting, there are quick instructions on the [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) website on how to do this on your device.
